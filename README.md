# ShefRobot
Wrapper classes for Java code to interact with Lego EV3 robots.

Developed at the University of Sheffield, for use within the [COM1003: Java Programming](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/level1/com1003.html) module.

##Dependencies
Being a Java project, it is necessary to have the [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) setup on the machines wishing to build and use the code within this repository. The code been developed under Java version 8, however it is likely to work under any modern version.

In order to compile and run the code within this repository it is necessary to have the follow libraries on the classpath:

* [bluecove-2.1.0.jar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluecove/files/BlueCove/2.1.0/)
* [ev3classes.jar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ev3.lejos.p/files/0.9.0-beta/) (Available within the lib dir of the beta_win32.zip or beta.tar.gz downloads)
* [dbusJava](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings/#java) (Prebuilt version available with ev3classes.jar download)

The implementation has only been tested with the above specified versions.

##Build
The below sections explain how to build a jar and the documentation for this project, due to the cross-platform nature of Java these commands should be identical between operating systems.
